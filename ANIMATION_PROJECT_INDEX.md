## üí° Key Concepts Explained

### What is "Multi-layer Parallax"?
Background elements move at different speeds as you scroll, creating a sense of depth (like looking through a window with multiple layers of scenery).

**Impact:** Makes hero section feel immersive and three-dimensional.

### What is "3D Tilt Effect"?
Cards subtly rotate in 3D space following your mouse cursor, as if they're real objects you can inspect.

**Impact:** Makes cards feel tangible and interactive, increases engagement.

### What is "Text Reveal Animation"?
Text appears one character or word at a time, revealing itself like a typewriter or fade-in effect.

**Impact:** Draws attention to key messaging, creates anticipation.

### What is "Magnetic Button Effect"?
Buttons subtly move toward your cursor when you hover nearby, as if magnetically attracted.

**Impact:** Makes interactions feel responsive and satisfying.

### What is "Scroll-linked Animation"?
Elements animate based on your scroll position, not just appearing once.

**Impact:** Creates smooth, cinematic transitions between sections.
